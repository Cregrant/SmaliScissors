One day I'll make a alternative to the ApkEditor android app so this code isn't ready yet. Furthermore the patches still throw errors to me.
I am using BatchApktool to decompile and complile apks & patches from 4PDA to test.
My final goal is to make a "magic" button that will cut out some parts of an apk code and fix the problems by itself (or help to fix).
